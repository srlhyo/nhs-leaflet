# nhs-leaflet
This little project was born from a chat with my big brother Krizalias. He just got into web developement and all the help he can get to make is learning expericence better than it was mine, is my main goal here. Plus, since the project will only involve HTML and CSS, it will be a great opportunity for me to brush up on the core technologies for building web pages
