# NHS-leaflet-page
This little project was born from a chat with my big brother Krizalias. He just got into web developement and all the help he can get to make is learning expericence better than it was mine, is my main goal here. Plus, since the project will only involve HTML and CSS, it will be a great opportunity for me to brush up on the core technologies for building web pages  

## Walkthrough the web development approach
I randomly picked a design I wanted to translate into web and it happened to be an nhs leaflet kept in my drawer it's been months. 
First thing I did was to spend a few minutes looking at the design and decide what part of the designed I would want to focus all the development; I guess working in small chunks helps me finish something I start whithout losing interest too quick. 

Next, I took a screenshot of the leaflet and downloaded into my pc and with a screenshot app I drew boxes around the elements that make up the page and wrote in front of each one the html tags that I think to be appropriated to create the page structure. Instead of the app, pen and paper could be an option too **See screenshots!**

### Look up information
One extra step I like to do is looking up information regarding things I don't fully understand. Googling, reading documentation, asking foruns as such are some of the ways; it's all down to preference or based on how one learns better anything. I personally I like consult any great documentation on anything that I am working on web development. For instance, I know more or less how to go about building the leaflet header based on the highlightings I done, but to make sure my though process is implementing the best practices out there, I always like to check documentations, videos and other resources for some time. Here's a link for a great documentation that can help me with the project -> [click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

### Web page html
Without going into details,`HTML` is a markup language that tells the browser how the document content is structured. There are a lot of resources on internet that explain how to code `HTML`, its syntax and anatomy - __*one of them is the link above*__  including but essentially `HTML` is  made up of opening and closing tags which together form elements.

I recommend anyone that just started or knows very little about the topic to go and do some research as it is important to solidifying important knowledge acquired along the learning journey. For exemple, I know that `HTML 5` introduced new elments that provide with meaning, making it easier for browesers to understand the content which improves `SEO`; screen readers software with giving a better web pages navigation experience to impared visual user and to developers to understand and maintain the source code. **Here's a screenshot of my HTML code**

I could easily replaced `header` and `aside` elements by `div` since they are all doing the same: dividing or grouping content. But `header` and `aside` provide meaning. That is, you can easily understand that `header` is the header of the whole document and `aside` is a piece of information that isn't directly related to the main content; it kind of warns and says something that it's worth to keep an eye or to know.
